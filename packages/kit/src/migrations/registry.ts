/**

 * This is the structured form of `blit-tech`'s `docs/deprecations.md`: each entry mirrors one dated section of that

 * section 4.6). New games rarely need these, but a project that upgrades across the rename can use `blit migrate`.

 * old name is a common English word (`equals`, `contains`, `intersects`, `tick`) are marked `review` - they could match
 * unrelated code, so they are reported rather than rewritten.
