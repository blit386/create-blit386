# create-blit386

Scaffolder and kit for [BLIT386](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386) games. This monorepo holds two published
packages:

- **`create-blit386`** (`packages/create-blit386`) - the `npm create blit386` scaffolder. Asks a couple of quick
  questions, then writes a ready-to-run game project.
- **`/kit`** (`packages/kit`) - the canonical AI docs (`AGENTS.md` + local `docs/`) plus the project-local `blit` CLI
  (`run`, `doctor`, `upgrade`, `agents sync`, `agents add`).

## Quick start (for users)

```bash
npm create blit386@latest my-game
cd my-game
npm install
npm run dev
```

The scaffolder auto-detects whichever package manager you used (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`).

## Never used Node.js before?

The command above needs **Node.js** - a free program that runs JavaScript on your computer. The instructions live here,
on this page, on purpose: a brand-new project cannot teach you to install the thing it needs to exist. One-time setup:

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the button marked **LTS** ("the stable one").
2. Install it like any other app: keep clicking Next or Continue.
3. Open a terminal (your editor has one built in - in Zed or VS Code, look for "Terminal" in the menu). If the editor
   was already open, quit and reopen it first so it notices Node.
4. Now run the Quick start commands above, one line at a time.

A zero-install path that runs entirely in the browser (StackBlitz) is planned; once it ships, this section will lead
with it.

Starting someone else off? Copy and paste this message:

> Want to make a little pixel game? First install Node.js: go to nodejs.org, download the LTS button, and install it

> `npm create blit386@latest my-game`, then `cd my-game`, then `npm run dev`. A web address appears - open it in your
> browser and you are playing your own game. Open `src/game.js` to change it; every line has a comment that explains
> itself.

## Development (this repo)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build        # build both packages with tsup
pnpm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit per package
pnpm run test         # scaffolder smoke test (needs a build first)
pnpm run preflight    # format:check + lint + typecheck + spellcheck + knip + docs:links + build + test
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks on every push and pull request to `main`.

## Status

Phase 2 ("agents on tap") is complete: the JavaScript and TypeScript scaffolds, the Catcher starter game, local docs,
and the `blit` CLI. When you choose an AI assistant in the wizard, the scaffolder generates its config (Claude or
Cursor) from the kit's canonical content, and `npx blit agents sync` keeps those files current without clobbering your
edits. `npx blit agents add <claude|cursor>` sets up an assistant later for a project that started without one. See
[`CREATE_BLIT386_DESIGN.md`](CREATE_BLIT386_DESIGN.md) for the full roadmap.

Publishing to npm is a deliberate, manual step and is not automated here.
