# Review Changes

Review current changes against create-blit-tech conventions and quality standards.

## Usage

```text
/cbt-review
```

## Steps

1. **Gather changes**

- Run `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --cached` (staged)
- List which files changed and what changed

2. **Run automated checks**

- `pnpm run lint` - Biome lint
- `pnpm run typecheck` - TypeScript across all packages
- `pnpm run spellcheck` - cspell

3. **Check against project rules**

- No emoji anywhere (code, docs, user-facing strings, commits)
- Named exports only in library TypeScript; no default exports
- Beginner-friendly comments in scaffold templates and kit content
- Scaffold templates: placeholders render (no leftover `{{tokens}}`); optional wizard flags copy the right
  `templates/optional/` trees; generated `package.json` must not leak `workspace:*`
- Kit content is self-contained: skills and docs reference only `blit-tech` and other local kit files, never the
  `blit-tech-demos` repo
- Generated game code uses public `BT` names from the sibling `blit-tech` repo
- Docs and kit content updated when workflow or architecture changes (see `.claude/rules/docs-sync-required.md`)

4. **Summarize findings**

- List critical issues to fix, then warnings, then suggestions

## Output Format

```md
## Critical Issues

- [File:Line] Description of issue

## Warnings

- [File:Line] Description of warning

## Suggestions

- Consider doing X for better Y

## Summary

Overall assessment of the changes and readiness for a commit.
```

## Notes

- Run or suggest `pnpm run preflight` before approving; it is the full gate (format, lint, typecheck, spellcheck, knip,
  docs:links, build, test).
